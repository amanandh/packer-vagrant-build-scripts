# Pre-steps to take
In order for the host system to send environment variables to the guest Vm being built you have to explicitly declare them on the command line before you issue a ```packer build``` command.

This is how we are passing passwords/RSA keys securely.

[https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html)

### What we need to set username and passwords securely in Packer
1) Issue the command inside of the folder, ```cp variables-sample.json variables.json```
    1) The ```variables.json``` file contains key value pairs of variables and passwords to be passed into the provisioner shell script.
    1) This renames the file ```variables-sample.json``` to ```variables.json```  (there is an entry in the .gitignore so you cannot accidentially git push your passwords).
1) Edit the ```variables.json``` file replacing default values with your own    
1) Issue the command ```packer build --var-file=./variables.json ubuntu16045-itmt430-database.json``` and ```packer build --var-file=./variables.json ubuntu16045-itmt430-webserver.json``` to begin the install with password, usernames, and RSA private key properly seeded
    1) This way we can securely build the system, deploy it and when building it pass in passwords via environment variables
